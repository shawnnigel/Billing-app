#Billing App
This is an app I made to practice my web dev skills.

The UI uses CSS3 with sass and uses the Bootstrap Framework to make it responsive (fit both Desktop and mobile screens).

Calculations on the client side are done using jQuery.
The Backend of this app is built with Ruby On Rails Framework, with a PostgreSQL database.
Authentication features like account creation,login & reset password have been added. A User can create invoices , print invoices and view his Total Billings by date in form of a Graph.

This web application is hosted at: https://invoicebook.herokuapp.com
